# Ironhack. Week 01

## The day arrived

At least, after two months of considering, deciding and making the prework (I speed almost 40 hours with it), the classes started. We met our teacher, [Rafa de Castro](https://twitter.com/rafadc). 

In Ironhack courses every week we have a different teacher, teaching different subject. 

Our cohort is formed by 13 people. There are from UK, Germany, Lithuania, Canada, Venezuela, Colombia and Spain.

## The teacher

Rafa, an excellent [Rubyst](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Rubyist), and a twisted mind designing programming exercises, was a great and patient teacher. 

I was surprissed to see some students with no previous programming experience, fighting against very difficult exercises. Not only language was new for them, also the keyboard (regular users don't use brackets nor know anything about shortcuts), the code editor ... We use [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

When finished first week, **nobody abandoned**. Great! Good news!

## Ironhack talks

As part of our learning, Ironhack has programmed a series of talks done by interesting people. 

On **Tuesday**, [Xavi Leal](https://twitter.com/lealxavi), Ironhack COO, talked to us about __"How to get a job after IH"__
