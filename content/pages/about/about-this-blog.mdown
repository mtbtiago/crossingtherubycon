# About this blog

>The idiom "Crossing the Rubicon" means to pass a point of no return, and refers to Julius Caesar's army's crossing of the river in 49 BC, which was considered an act of insurrection (...). The river is perhaps most known as the place where Julius Caesar uttered the famous phrase "alea iacta est" â€“ the die is cast.<cite> -- [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubicon)</cite>

For me, starting to learn Ruby was a mean of _crossing the Rub[i,y]con_. This blog is devoted to [**Ruby**](www.ruby-lang.org/), [**Sinatra**](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and [**Rails**](http://rubyonrails.org/), despite some other tech issues can fit there.

My first motivation with it is to practise the Ruby language.
His blog is powered by [**Nesta**](http://nestacms.com), a CMS entirely written in Ruby.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:tiago.ameller@gmail.com) for any suggestion or complaint.
And ... please, be condescendent with my poor coding. I'm just begining to learn.
