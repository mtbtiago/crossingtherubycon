# You live and learn or you don't live long

Today, as a serendipity, I found this quote. It's from [Robert A. Heinlein](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/205.Robert_A_Heinlein), an author I didn't know until today. 
I'm writing about him because this quote says the same I wrote in the [about me](about/about-me) of this blog. Now I see this is true as live: *don't stop learning, my friend*.
