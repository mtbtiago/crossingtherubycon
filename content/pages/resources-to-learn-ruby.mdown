# Resources to learn Ruby

Here, with any special order, are a lot of links than served to me:

* The [Ruby docs](http://ruby-doc.org/)
* Official [repository of _gems_](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com), the soul of **Ruby**
* [Awesome print](https://github.com/michaeldv/awesome_print) will help you in _puts oriented development_
* Test your *Regular Expresions* (AKA RegEx) with this [online tool](http://rubular.com/)
* Two tools for manage user login in your Rails apps:
	* *Devise*, the most powerful is [here](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
	* [Sorcery](https://github.com/NoamB/sorcery)
